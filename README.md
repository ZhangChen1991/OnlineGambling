This repository contains three folders. The folder `Complete` contains all code to preprocess raw data files and analyse the summary data. To run the code in this folder, one will need the round-level raw data provided by Gaming1.

The folder `docs` contains the data analysis results as html files, and can be shown online as a website.

The folder `Final-Share` contains all code to analyse the summary data. All results reported in the manuscript can be reproduced using the per player summary data. This folder may be shared with other researchers for verification purpose.
